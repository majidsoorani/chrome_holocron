# SSH Tunnel Manager for Work Networks
#
# Description:
# This script automatically starts or stops an SSH tunnel when on a designated
# work Wi-Fi network. It creates a lock file to manage the tunnel's state.
#
# Requirements:
# The script uses 'wdutil' to detect the network, which requires administrator
# privileges. You will be prompted for your password via `sudo` when starting.
# For automated/passwordless use, see the "Advanced Usage" section below.
#
# Usage:
# ./tunnel.sh {start|stop|restart|status}
# ==============================================================================

# --- Configuration ---
# Add ALL your work Wi-Fi network names (SSIDs) inside the parentheses.
WORK_SSIDS=("X28P-5G-AFC960" "X28-5G-AFC960" "X28-2.4G-552360" "X28-5G-552360" "X28P-2.4G-AFC960" "<redacted>") # <-- EDIT THIS LINE
LOCK_FILE="$HOME/.ssh/holocron_tunnel.lock"

# --- SSH Connection Details (Use environment variables for secrets) ---
# For security best practices, set these in your shell profile (~/.zshrc, etc.)
# Example:
#   export SSH_USER="ubuntu"
#   export SSH_HOST="bastion.example.com"
#   export DB_HOST="your-rds-instance.rds.amazonaws.com"
SSH_USER="${SSH_USER:-ubuntu}"
SSH_HOST="${SSH_HOST:-34.244.201.246}"
DB_HOST="${DB_HOST:-warehouse.cluster-cpmkv4ljjrvu.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com}"

# --- Full paths for reliability ---
SSH_PATH="/usr/bin/ssh"
WDUTIL_PATH="/usr/bin/wdutil"

# --- Advanced Usage: Passwordless Sudo (for automation) ---
# To run this script from an automated service (like launchd) without a password
# prompt, you can allow your user to run wdutil without a password.
# 1. Open the sudoers file by running: `sudo visudo`
# 2. Add this line at the end, replacing 'your_username' with your macOS username:
#    your_username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/wdutil
# 3. Save and exit. This is a powerful change; be certain of the security implications.
