# Holocron SSH Tunnel Manager
#
# Description:
# This script automatically starts or stops an SSH tunnel when on a designated
# work Wi-Fi network. It receives all connection parameters via command-line
# arguments and uses a lock file to manage the tunnel's state.
#
# Requirements:
# The script uses 'wdutil' to detect the network, which requires administrator
# privileges. For passwordless use, see the "Passwordless Sudo" section.
# ==============================================================================
